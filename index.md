### CPSC 120

* Lab 6

Lab 6 as a whole was an interesting challenge in learning how to use operators. The simplicity in part 1 of only needing to find the area of a rectangle from user inputs was easy enough to pick up & apply into part 2. Part 2 was an unique challenge; albeit hard, wasn't too hard to feel near impossible & felt incredibly satisfying to get down & complete. Overall, this lab as a whole is one of my favorites for its straightforward set up.

* Lab 7

Lab 7 was a hard challenge. Although consisting of 1 part, was fun work through. The combined utilization of operators, if/else statements, etc., blended together for a surprisingly fun challenge to work through. I was never able to fully complete the lab however due to the complexities of the lab's final section, but I viewed it as a good & entertaining way of attempting to figure out how to code it into a functional version.
