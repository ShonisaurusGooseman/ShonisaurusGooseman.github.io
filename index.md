### CPSC 120

* Lab 6

Lab 6 as a whole was an interesting challenge in learning how to use operators. The simplicity in part 1 of only needing to find the area of a rectangle from user inputs was easy enough to pick up & apply into part 2. Part 2 was an unique challenge; albeit hard, wasn't too hard to feel near impossible & felt incredibly satisfying to get down & complete. Overall, this lab as a whole is one of my favorites for its straightforward set up.

* Lab 7

Lab 7 was a hard challenge. Although consisting of 1 part, was fun work through. The combined utilization of operators, if/else statements, etc., blended together for a surprisingly fun challenge to work through. I was never able to fully complete the lab however due to the complexities of the lab's final section, but I viewed it as a good & entertaining way of attempting to figure out how to code it into a functional version.

* Lab 8

Lab 8 felt like 2 different smaller labs that helped convey my understanding of C++ up until that point. Part 1 was a hard challenge which let me think on how I would be using elements of the language to solve an issue & relearning other elements which I've forgotten about until that point. Part 2-whilst I view as easier than part 1-has expanded my view on using for loops; specifically, nested for loops, and learning how to utilize them to retrieve a specific output. Overall, I view this as a great checkpoint to relearn &/or strengthen my understanding on C++'s elements & how to utilize them to achieve certain goals.
